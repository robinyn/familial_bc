# Variant Annotation Pipeline

The pipeline presented here is a synonymous variant annotation pipeline based on the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor, adapted and updated from the original pipeline developed by Arthur Boffelli Castro. The pipeline annotates variants with features relevant for identifying potentially functional synonymous variants, such as their population allele frequencies, phyloP conservation scores, change in relative synonymous codon usage (dRSCU), overlapping exonic splicing enhancer/silencer (ESE/ESS) motifs, and RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding sites (RBS).

## Version 1
The original pipeline developed by Arthur Boffelli Castero, which can be found [here](https://github.com/aboffelli/variant_annotation).

## Version 2
The version of the pipeline used for the analysis of synonymous variants from the SWEA and BRIDGES cohorts as a part of the thesis project "Identification of candidate pathogenic synonymous variants in familial breast cancer". The instructions on running the pipeline and the analysis workflow used in the project can be found [here](/scripts/1_variant_annotation/v2).

## Version 3
The optimized and updated version of the pipeline, with increased performance and added features. The instructions for installing and running the pipeline can be found [here](/scripts/1_variant_annotation/v3).
